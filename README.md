For each oscillator you can control:

- Oscillator Shape -> you can choose amongst 6 oscillator shapes : sine, square, rounded square, triangle, sawtooth and random (white noise).
- Stereo Phase Offset -> allow to get different phases offset for the right and left channel.
- Stereo Detune -> allow to get a different tunning between the left and right channel.
- Coarse Tunning -> change the tunning of the oscillator (-24 to +24 semitones).
- Fine Tunning -> change the tunning of the oscillator (-100 to +100 cents).
- Panning -> Set the stereo panning.
- Mixing Level -> Set the mixing level of the oscillator relatively to the first oscillator.

You also have a Master Volume to control the overall amplitude of the synth.
